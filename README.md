## FlexABLE - A Workout Planner For Regular People

You should work out, but you don't (although everyone says there's exactly 4 gajillion reasons on why it's good for you). Welcome to the club. If you're like me, committing yourself to actually working out has some challenges.

1) The only exercise you know by name is the Pushup (You want to reference an 'exercise dictionary')
2) You're worried you will become lopsided after you workout (You want to know what exercises to do to develop what muscles)
3) How much weight did I lift last week? How did it feel? (You want help tracking your progression)
4) What fun stuff can I do with my muscles? (You want to see fun activities that test your fitness)

FlexABLE is a workout planner that helps you get learn how to exercise, plan your workouts, and find ways to provide meaning to your newly acquired fitness. 

## Introduction

FlexABLE is a full-stack web application for desktop platforms build using ReactJS for the frontend and Rails API as a backend. It is my final project built over the course of 3 weeks during my software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron. 

### Project Requirements
The following are the requirements provided to me from Flatiron as a basis for the project. I have marked 'x's on requirements I tried tackling.

The listed requirements below are guidelines that should help you to determine what the complexity of your project should be. They are not hard and fast rules, and final project approval is up to your leads and SECs, who will be acting as project managers.

#### Backend
Your project must use a non-trivial Rails backend. Consult the following list for examples of things to include. You do not need to include all of these things, and the final decision of what must be included will be up to your project managers.

[x] Auth

[ ] Tests

[ ] Multiple has_many_through relationships

[ ] Seeds from a complex data set

[x] Custom routes

[x] Custom controller/model methods

[x] Basic database query optimizations

[ ] Background jobs for slow actions

[ ] Sockets or email integration

[x] One significant refactor

[x] Validation


#### Frontend
Your product must use a React based frontend. Consult the following list for examples of things to include. You do not need to include all of these things, and the final decision of what must be included will be up to your project manager.

[x] Auth

[ ] Tests

[ ] Interacting with a complex API

[x] Redux

[x] Custom CSS

[x] One significant refactor
